Trying to solve a pyramix

DAY 1: first time solving two sides, but I don't know how I even did that. I'm currently able to solve one side, still unsure on how to solve the rest of the other three sides. I've been looking at a tutorial, but still no luck with actually solving the pyramix. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0FUvaaUsI)
