Trying to solve a pyramix

DAY 1: first time solving two sides, but I don't know how I even did that. I'm currently able to solve one side, still unsure on how to solve the rest of the other three sides. I've been looking at a tutorial, but still no luck with actually solving the pyramix. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0FUvaaUsI)                                        

DAY 2:  i'm still having problems trying to solve the other three sides, I was finally able to solve one by through the tutorial, but i'm not fully ready to actually solve with no use of help, i'm only getting one of the methods from the tutorial to solve it
