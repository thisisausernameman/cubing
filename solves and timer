Trying to solve a pyramix

DAY 1: first time solving two sides, but I don't know how I even did that. I'm currently able to solve one side, still unsure on how to solve the rest of the other three sides. I've been looking at a tutorial, but still no luck with actually solving the pyramix. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H0FUvaaUsI)                                        

DAY 2:  i'm still having problems trying to solve the other three sides, I was finally able to solve one by through the tutorial, but i'm not fully ready to actually solve with no use of help, i'm only getting one of the methods from the tutorial to solve it

DAY 3: What I really want to do now is to try to find more ways to solve the other three sides when I finish one of the sides, right now I have found 1 way, now I want to find more ways, i'm just solving two sides repeatedlt and still I don't even know am i even doing it. so i just somehow solved all four sides, but i really don't know how, i just wanted to get a piece of green to go in it's side and somehow that just solved the whole thing, I still need for time to have more methods so I can solve the pyramix.
